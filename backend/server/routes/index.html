The collaborative coding project you&apos;ve poured months into is due in 48 hours. But the website is glitching and broken, and new, bizarre lines of code keep appearing in the project files.

[[Panic and email the professor.|Panic Mode]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata name="Decoding the Digital Footprints" pid="2">You run `git status`. The output shows modified files you didn&apos;t touch. Unexplained additions and deletions are flagged.

[[Commit the changes anyway, hoping it fixes things.|Reckless Commit]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata name="Unmasking the Code Changes" pid="3">Using `git diff`, you see the exact lines of code that have been altered. The changes are nonsensical and seem intentionally destructive, there are a lot of files modified you don&apos;t remember working on.

[[Investigate the commit history with `git log`.|Following the trail]]
[[Try to manually fix the errors yourself.|Manual Mayhem]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata name="Following the trail" pid="4">You run `git log` and examine the commit history. You notice commits from an unknown user or a user making commits at odd hours with suspicious commit messages. You see a few commits stand out with messages like &quot;Fixed Bug&quot; or &quot;Added Feature&quot; from a user named &quot;GhostCoder&quot;

You notice the changes are to a core library and that the changes have introduced a series of errors. You need to revert these changes.

[[Try to manually fix the errors yourself.|Manual Mayhem]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata name="Safe Harbor" pid="6">You create a new branch called &quot;security-fix&quot; using `git branch security-fix` and then switch to it using `git checkout security-fix`.

[[Revert the problematic commits in the new branch.|Erasing the Damage]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata name="Erasing the Damage" pid="7">You use `git revert &lt;commit_hash&gt;` to undo the &quot;GhostCoder&apos;s&quot; commits.
