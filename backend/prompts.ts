*“Create a detailed Twine-style branching outline for an educational interactive story based on the provided theme and prompt.
The outline should include:

A clear starting passage

6–12 story nodes, each with a brief description

Meaningful choices leading to different branches

Educational takeaways woven into the decisions

At least two positive endings and two cautionary endings
Keep the outline concise, modular, and structured so another LLM can easily expand it into full Twine passages.`
